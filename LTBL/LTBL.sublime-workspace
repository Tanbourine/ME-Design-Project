Where that question matters ...\n00:01:41 ...in the 50's and 60's than it was later. Where that question matters a lot for us, where it's a perfect segue, Mr. Katsky, is that religion ...\n00:01:46 ...a lot for us, where it's a perfect segue, Mr. Katsky, is that religion was an important part of the civil rights movement, which is what ...\n00:01:48 ...was an important part of the civil rights movement, which is what we're talking about today. Again, not always front and center ...\n00:01:51 ...we're talking about today.

And it has a number of the elements of what we're gonna be talking about ...\n00:03:19 ...And it has a number of the elements of what we're gonna be talking about today. First, there's an argument for equality, for fairness and the argument ...\n00:03:24 ...today. First, there's an argument for equality, for fairness and the argument is made surrounding housing and other basic elements of life. ...\n00:03:28 ...is made surrounding housing and other basic elements of life. Housing and jobs, equal rights, housing and jobs. The ladies here ...\n00:03:34 ...Housing and jobs, equal rights, housing and jobs. The ladies here are dominating discussion. Too often, we write about, think about protest ...\n00:03:38 ...are dominating discussion. Too often, we write about, think about protest as male activities, or images are often male. But many protests, ...\n00:03:42 ...as male activities, or images are often male. But many protests, especially during the Civil Rights Movement were led and dominated by, ...\n00:03:45 ...especially during the Civil Rights Movement were led and dominated by, organized by, in many ways, managed by women. ...\n00:03:49 ...organized by, in many ways, managed by women. Women play a key role. You see African-Americans here. ...\n00:03:52 ...Women play a key role. You see African-Americans here. But there was also white women and one commented on that. ...\n00:03:56 ...But there was also white women and one commented on that. No one commented that there's a white woman holding the ...\n00:03:57 ...No one commented that there's a white woman holding the 'We march for jobs for all a decent pay now!' ...\n00:04:02 ...'We march for jobs for all a decent pay now!' These protests, these civil rights activities that we'll talk about today, ...\n00:04:06 ...These protests, these civil rights activities that we'll talk about today, were about equality, were about racial equality and they were to some ...\n00:04:09 ...were about equality, were about racial equality and they were to some extent biracial. It doesn't mean you had equal representation of whites ...\n00:04:13 ...extent biracial. It doesn't mean you had equal representation of whites and African-Americans and males and females, but they were biracial. ...\n00:04:17 ...and African-Americans and males and females, but they were biracial. They involved people from different groups, particularly young white ...\n00:04:22 ...They involved people from different groups, particularly young white students, perhaps like many of you, going from the north, from northern ...\n00:04:26 ...students, perhaps like many of you, going from the north, from northern universities, University of Wisconsin, University of Michigan and elsewhere ...\n00:04:30 ...universities, University of Wisconsin, University of Michigan and elsewhere going south to march with southerners, with southern students and ...\n00:04:34 ...going south to march with southerners, with southern students and southern citizens. Together, white and black, students and non-students ...\n00:04:38 ...southern citizens. Together, white and black, students and non-students in these demonstrations. What's crucial here that I've hoped you captured or ...\n00:04:42 ...in these demonstrations. What's crucial here that I've hoped you captured or what you see in this image - can we go back to it one more second? ...\n00:04:45 ...what you see in this image - can we go back to it one more second? Is there's nothing really radical about it. It's a claim for equality. ...\n00:04:50 ...Is there's nothing really radical about it. It's a claim for equality. It's a claim for fairness. It's a claim to be treated like other citizens. ...\n00:04:53 ...It's a claim for fairness. It's a claim to be treated like other citizens. Notice how they are dressed too. They are not dressed, these women, ...\n00:04:56 ...Notice how they are dressed too. They are not dressed, these women, like radicals. They are dressed like ordinary working class or middle class ...\n00:05:00 ...like radicals. They are dressed like ordinary working class or middle class individuals. This is what we would conceive of someone like that looking. ...\n00:05:05 ...individuals. This is what we would conceive of someone like that looking. These ladies are making a claim on citizenship. They are making a claim ...\n00:05:10 ...These ladies are making a claim on citizenship. They are making a claim to be treated as they believe they should be treated, and are ...\n00:05:14 ...to be treated as they believe they should be treated, and are entitled to be treated in the Constitution. ...\n00:05:16 ...entitled to be treated in the Constitution. They are making the most powerful claim a protester can ever make, ...\n00:05:21 ...They are making the most powerful claim a protester can ever make, which is not that the people in power have the wrong ideas, ...\n00:05:25 ...which is not that the people in power have the wrong ideas, instead-- let's go back to that image one more time-- they're making ...\n00:05:28 ...instead-- let's go back to that image one more time-- they're making the claim that those in power have the right ideas ...\n00:05:30 ...the claim that those in power have the right ideas but they're not applying them. That, of course you believe in decent ...\n00:05:34 ...but they're not applying them. That, of course you believe in decent housing, who doesn't? Of course you believe in jobs. Of course you believe ...\n00:05:37 ...housing, who doesn't? Of course you believe in jobs. Of course you believe in equality, why wouldn't you? The problem is you're not ...\n00:05:40 ...in equality, why wouldn't you? The problem is you're not living up to your ideals. The most powerful challenge to any ...\n00:05:43 ...living up to your ideals. The most powerful challenge to any powerful group is when their ideas, their` claims are affirmed, but ...\n00:05:49 ...powerful group is when their ideas, their` claims are affirmed, but those who are not receiving the benefits point that out ...\n00:05:53 ...those who are not receiving the benefits point that out and say, \"You are not living up to your own ideas.\" ...\n00:05:56 ...and say, \"You are not living up to your own ideas.\" You are not living up to your own ideas. ...\n00:05:58 ...You are not living up to your own ideas. These are not revolutionaries, these ladies. These are ...\n00:06:01 ...These are not revolutionaries, these ladies. These are claimants upon democratic rights. These are individuals ...\n00:06:05 ...claimants upon democratic rights. These are individuals claiming that the existing justifications for society and ...\n00:06:09 ...claiming that the existing justifications for society and governance are not being fulfilled. They are demanding the ...\n00:06:13 ...governance are not being fulfilled. They are demanding the fulfillment of the promises of those in power. ...\n00:06:16 ...fulfillment of the promises of those in power. They are not challenging those promises, they are demanding the ...\n00:06:18 ...They are not challenging those promises, they are demanding the fulfillment of the promises of those in power. ...\n00:06:20 ...fulfillment of the promises of those in power. This is a very important point for us for understanding the period ...\n00:06:25 ...This is a very important point for us for understanding the period around the 1960's, this second American Reconstruction. ...\n00:06:28 ...around the 1960's, this second American Reconstruction. It's a very important point for us in understanding American ...\n00:06:31 ...It's a very important point for us in understanding American society as a whole, and understanding this entire course. One of the key ...\n00:06:35 ...society as a whole, and understanding this entire course. One of the key drivers of this course has been war, and the changes that ...\n00:06:37 ...drivers of this course has been war, and the changes that come after war. One of the biggest changes that come through war ...\n00:06:41 ...come after war. One of the biggest changes that come through war are that citizens who have participated in a war, either directly in the ...\n00:06:46 ...are that citizens who have participated in a war, either directly in the frontlines or behind the frontlines supporting the war effort, make a claim ...\n00:06:51 ...frontlines or behind the frontlines supporting the war effort, make a claim that now that they have participated in the war, they have the right ...\n00:06:55 ...that now that they have participated in the war, they have the right to participate in the other promises of society. ...\n00:06:58 ...to participate in the other promises of society. It is very difficult to deny those who have put their lives on the line ...\n00:07:02 ...It is very difficult to deny those who have put their lives on the line the full claims of citizenship that they might be denied otherwise. ...\n00:07:07 ...the full claims of citizenship that they might be denied otherwise. It is in that post-war moment that existing claims, existing promises, ...\n00:07:12 ...It is in that post-war moment that existing claims, existing promises, existing rights, existing constitutional provisions that have not been ...\n00:07:16 ...existing rights, existing constitutional provisions that have not been fully carried out are pulled, are tugged at, are demanded to move into ...\n00:07:21 ...fully carried out are pulled, are tugged at, are demanded to move into places they had not moved before by those who have ...\n00:07:24 ...places they had not moved before by those who have lived through those wars. We had a number of those ...\n00:07:26 ...lived through those wars. We had a number of those post-war moments already. The Civil War was one of them. ...\n00:07:30 ...post-war moments already. The Civil War was one of them. Remember our discussion of the Civil War and the period after it. ...\n00:07:33 ...Remember our discussion of the Civil War and the period after it. How could you forget? The war is not initially about freeing all the slaves. ...\n00:07:38 ...How could you forget? The war is not initially about freeing all the slaves. It was a war about slavery, but Lincoln was looking for a mechanism ...\n00:07:41 ...It was a war about slavery, but Lincoln was looking for a mechanism to keep the Union together and slowly get rid of slavery. ...\n00:07:45 ...to keep the Union together and slowly get rid of slavery. But instead, the nature of the war leads him to become firmly ...\n00:07:51 ...But instead, the nature of the war leads him to become firmly and immediately abolitionist, and it allows for claims-- and this is what ...\n00:07:55 ...and immediately abolitionist, and it allows for claims-- and this is what Steven Hahn's book is about as well-- claims by freed slaves. ...\n00:07:59 ...Steven Hahn's book is about as well-- claims by freed slaves. Claims by African Americans in the North, and claims by other groups ...\n00:08:03 ...Claims by African Americans in the North, and claims by other groups that pull the Lincolnian vision into many, many more spaces. ...\n00:08:06 ...that pull the Lincolnian vision into many, many more spaces. That's why James McPherson calls it the second American Revolution, ...\n00:08:11 ...That's why James McPherson calls it the second American Revolution, it expands notions of freedom. Coming out of the Civil War, we have ...\n00:08:14 ...it expands notions of freedom. Coming out of the Civil War, we have a more expansive set of notions of freedom and more expansive ...\n00:08:17 ...a more expansive set of notions of freedom and more expansive claims on those freedoms, and the federal government is set up ...\n00:08:20 ...claims on those freedoms, and the federal government is set up now as more of a rights and freedom provider than it ever was before. ...\n00:08:27 ...[ring] Woah. I'd like to have a bell. Ding! ...\n00:08:30 ...I'd like to have a bell. Ding! World War II did the same thing, World War II and the New Deal. ...\n00:08:34 ...World War II did the same thing, World War II and the New Deal. They produced a new set of claims upon rights. ...\n00:08:38 ...They produced a new set of claims upon rights. If this war about the spread of democracy, if this war was ...\n00:08:42 ...If this war about the spread of democracy, if this war was about defending democracy, if it was about defeating authoritarian, ...\n00:08:46 ...about defending democracy, if it was about defeating authoritarian, racist, anti-Semitic threats to democracy, it opened a space for more claims, ...\n00:08:52 ...racist, anti-Semitic threats to democracy, it opened a space for more claims, more claims on what democratic rights should be. ...\n00:08:55 ...more claims on what democratic rights should be. More claims on government resources. More claims on the ...\n00:09:00 ...More claims on government resources. More claims on the ability of societies and individuals to prosper as they had not before. ...\n00:09:04 ...ability of societies and individuals to prosper as they had not before. And after World War II, you also see more claims. We talked about this ...\n00:09:07 ...And after World War II, you also see more claims. We talked about this with education, for example. Everyone remember our ...\n00:09:09 ...with education, for example. Everyone remember our discussion of the Cold War university. What the Cold War ...\n00:09:11 ...discussion of the Cold War university. What the Cold War university represented, it represented now the claim that servicemen ...\n00:09:16 ...university represented, it represented now the claim that servicemen and women had, returning from war, to a right to get an education, ...\n00:09:20 ...and women had, returning from war, to a right to get an education, to a right to own a home. The G.I. Bill provided federal support for ...\n00:09:24 ...to a right to own a home. The G.I. Bill provided federal support for homeownership and higher education for those who served in war, ...\n00:09:27 ...homeownership and higher education for those who served in war, who never would have had a chance to have either of those before. ...\n00:09:30 ...who never would have had a chance to have either of those before. So, they had a claim, these individuals, for serving their country, ...\n00:09:32 ...So, they had a claim, these individuals, for serving their country, they said, \"Now, being free, when we come home we have a right to get ...\n00:09:35 ...they said, \"Now, being free, when we come home we have a right to get \"educated, we have a right to have homes.\" The war expanded ...\n00:09:38 ...\"educated, we have a right to have homes.\" The war expanded those claims into places they would not have been otherwise. That is the ...\n00:09:43 ...those claims into places they would not have been otherwise. That is the point of departure for the Civil Rights Movement, because what the ...\n00:09:45 ...point of departure for the Civil Rights Movement, because what the Civil Rights Movement was, in many ways, was a long set of claims that go back ...\n00:09:51 ...Civil Rights Movement was, in many ways, was a long set of claims that go back to the Civil War among freed slaves and African Americans and ...\n00:09:56 ...to the Civil War among freed slaves and African Americans and other minority groups, and come forward, get another push ...\n00:10:00 ...other minority groups, and come forward, get another push from World War II, and continue to push and, particularly by the 1960's, break ...\n00:10:05 ...from World War II, and continue to push and, particularly by the 1960's, break to the surface. These are claims upon not simply fair treatment, but claims ...\n00:10:10 ...to the surface. These are claims upon not simply fair treatment, but claims upon full participation and citizenship that has been denied for very long. ...\n00:10:16 ...upon full participation and citizenship that has been denied for very long. During the Cold War, these claims gain new currency, they gain ...\n00:10:20 ...During the Cold War, these claims gain new currency, they gain new power, because, as in World War II, during the Cold War, as we've ...\n00:10:24 ...new power, because, as in World War II, during the Cold War, as we've talked about already, the United States government is going around the ...\n00:10:27 ...talked about already, the United States government is going around the world claiming that we are the defenders of freedom ...\n00:10:29 ...world claiming that we are the defenders of freedom against the \"slave states\" of communist authority. ...\n00:10:34 ...against the \"slave states\" of communist authority. If we are to be the leader of the free world, if we are to be ...\n00:10:38 ...If we are to be the leader of the free world, if we are to be the society after World War II that protects democracy, if we ...\n00:10:41 ...the society after World War II that protects democracy, if we are to be the society that empowers countries to come out of empire ...\n00:10:44 ...are to be the society that empowers countries to come out of empire and out of communist control, how can we not do the same ...\n00:10:48 ...and out of communist control, how can we not do the same for our own citizens at home who are living in some ...\n00:10:50 ...for our own citizens at home who are living in some of those same conditions in parts of our country? ...\n00:10:53 ...of those same conditions in parts of our country? How can we be about freedom, how can we ask citizens, including ...\n00:10:57 ...How can we be about freedom, how can we ask citizens, including African Americans, to be part of the military, to be part of other ...\n00:11:00 ...African Americans, to be part of the military, to be part of other projects involved with spreading freedom around the world, ...\n00:11:03 ...projects involved with spreading freedom around the world, and not spread it at home? That's the claim that the ...\n00:11:08 ...and not spread it at home? That's the claim that the Civil Rights Movement makes. It doesn't challenge American ideals, ...\n00:11:12 ...Civil Rights Movement makes. It doesn't challenge American ideals, it asks for the application of those ideals, ideals we are promoting ...\n00:11:16 ...it asks for the application of those ideals, ideals we are promoting abroad, to be promoted, applied and defended at home. ...\n00:11:20 ...abroad, to be promoted, applied and defended at home. And it comes out of this post-war moment. ...\n00:11:23 ...And it comes out of this post-war moment. The act of fighting abroad empowers and opens freedoms at home. ...\n00:11:28 ...The act of fighting abroad empowers and opens freedoms at home. Many leaders lose sight of that. Actually, this is one of the ...\n00:11:31 ...Many leaders lose sight of that. Actually, this is one of the problems that happens in war. We underestimate what the changes ...\n00:11:35 ...problems that happens in war. We underestimate what the changes will be at home. Every war the United States has fought, particularly ...\n00:11:38 ...will be at home. Every war the United States has fought, particularly the recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, have led to huge changes ...\n00:11:42 ...the recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, have led to huge changes at home. It's one of the instabilities in our society today, it's one ...\n00:11:45 ...at home. It's one of the instabilities in our society today, it's one of the things we're dealing with in our society today. ...\n00:11:47 ...of the things we're dealing with in our society today. All those veterans who've come back from Iraq and Afghanistan ...\n00:11:50 ...All those veterans who've come back from Iraq and Afghanistan are trying to reintegrate into our society and having trouble doing that. ...\n00:11:54 ...are trying to reintegrate into our society and having trouble doing that. The act of fighting abroad fundamentally changes who you ...\n00:11:56 ...The act of fighting abroad fundamentally changes who you are at home. The Civil Rights Movement is part of that story. ...\n00:11:59 ...are at home. The Civil Rights Movement is part of that story. Issues of race and issues of civil rights had been central-- that's ...\n00:12:04 ...Issues of race and issues of civil rights had been central-- that's part of our course-- central to American politics since the Civil War, ...\n00:12:08 ...part of our course-- central to American politics since the Civil War, if not before.
